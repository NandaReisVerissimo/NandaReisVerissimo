Hello, I'm Fernanda A. R. Veríssimo👋

- 🔭 I’m not working at this moment. I have experience on chemical lab, and at this work I have helped to implement the LIMS system, being responsable to create this program for the entire company. The LIMS was a demand to ensure the quality of the laboratorial results. 
- 💻 I’m currently learning fullstack development at Rocketseat school
- 💧Recently I finished my doctorate degree in Environmental Sciences by UFRJ. In this course I was intoduced to programming language in R to propose statichal solutions for my environmental analysis. I spent hours trying to solve code problems and I didn't even see the time pass. At this moment, I realized that I was falling in love to challenges in programming and decide to start a course in this area.
